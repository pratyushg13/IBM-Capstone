    "Opening a new restaurant can be daunting. There are so many things to consider - the location, financing, and name. However, Location can make or break a restaurant.

One of the biggest questions to answer in a business plan for a new restaurant is to determine if the location has enough of a population base.\n",

    "k-means clustering method will be used for this exercise. It is an unsupervised model that divides data into K non-overlapping subsets or clusters without any cluster internal structure or labels. The purpose of the algorithm is to find groups in data based on similar characteristics. k-means is an iterative process that tries to minimize the intra-cluster distances and maximize the inter-cluster distances. It assigns each data point to a cluster and creates the number of clustered determined by the value of k. In each iteration, it will move the centroids, calculate the distances from new centroids, and assign data points to the nearest centroid. It results in the clusters with the smallest error or the densest clusters.\n",

We noticed pockets/clusters with very less competition fairly close to the city center. According to our initial assumption that high density of restaurants indicates high market potential indicates that Cluster 1 is the most suitable location to start a new restaurant. "
